# Welcome to the Single File Prototype

This is a single HTML file scaffold for creating styles, interactive, and dynamic prototypes. It imports **Vue JS** and **Tailwind CSS** via CDN enabling you to rapidly build "the thing" that you need to build to get the idea out of your head and on to a screen. Not designed for production apps. This is designed for the rapid expression of ideas without complex dependencies or local dev environments. 
Sharing your prototype is as simple as sharing the HTML file and as long as the recipient has a browser, they're a double-click away from seeing what you see.
